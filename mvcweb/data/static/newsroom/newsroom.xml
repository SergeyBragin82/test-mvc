  ORLANDO, Fla. &amp;#x2013; February 16, 2018
 &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;
 &amp;#x2013; The associates at Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;amp;#39;s Cove located in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands are excited to welcome back Owners and guests to this exceptional resort today. The resort has been closed since Hurricane Irma hit St. Thomas on September 6, 2017. Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;amp;#39;s Cove is one of the first large resorts on St. Thomas to open after recovering from the aftermath of two extremely powerful Category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Associates at Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;amp;#39;s Cove have been working hand-in-hand with the remediation company and other local vendors to return the resort to its original splendor all while dealing with their own personal challenges. The associates take such pride in the resort, and they want to ensure Owners and guests have a wonderful vacation experience when they return to St. Thomas. Upon reopening today, Owners and guests are able to enjoy the pool and hot tub, the beach has been cleared and is open for use, the pier is fully restored, the restaurant and Marketplace are open and operating and the resort activities department is operating normally. Crews will continue to work on landscaping and other projects, including building painting, throughout the resort over the next several weeks. Additionally, The Frenchman&amp;amp;#39;s Reef &amp;amp;amp; Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort remains closed due to hurricane damage until further notice.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 &amp;amp;#34;The unwavering dedication of our associates has shown through during this challenging time at Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;amp;#39;s Cove,&amp;amp;#34; said Scott Derrickson, general manager. &amp;amp;#34;I am so proud of the hard work our associates took on and completed to get the resort back open even though they were also affected personally by these storms. We are grateful to be welcoming our first Owners and guests back to the resort today.&amp;amp;#34;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 The island of St. Thomas continues to go through a lengthy recovery process. Many restaurants and shops have reopened for business and much of the foliage has made an incredible recovery. Local vendors throughout the island are thrilled to see one of the larger resorts reopening and are eager to be welcoming back visitors to the island. Multiple agencies and organizations have come together to restore St. Thomas, and progress updates are posted regularly by local officials. Visit

  ORLANDO, Fla. &amp;#x2013; June 1, 2017 &amp;#x2013;
 &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
 Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens&amp;#x2014;a new resort from Marriott Vacation Club&amp;#x2014;is expected to open January 1, 2018 in Bali, Indonesia. This island paradise, known for its incredible diversity and geographical wonders of ancient temples and palaces, is also home to world-class surfing and diving and a serene attitude framed by turquoise waters and curving coastlines. TripAdvisor recently called Bali the world&amp;amp;#39;s favorite destination.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Reservations can be made now by guests, Members and Owners for arrivals beginning January 1, 2018.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Marriott Vacation Club currently has three spectacular properties in Southeast Asia, including Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Phuket Beach Club and Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Mai Khao Beach, both in Phuket, Thailand, and Marriott Vacation Club at the Empire Place&amp;#xA9; in Bangkok, Thailand. The planned addition of Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens continues the company&amp;amp;#39;s growth strategy of adding new locations to its collection of properties and resorts in Asia.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Nestled within the Nusa Dua beachside community, Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens will feature 51 spacious 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, their design inspired by the vivid tropical beauty of Indonesia.  The new resort is also expected to share convenient access to amenities and activities* featured at the adjacent 5-star hotel, the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Nusa Dua, including on-site dining, lagoon-style pool and lazy river, fitness center and spa as well as access to private beach club amenities at Nusa Dua beach.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 The distinctive Bali National Golf Club is just minutes away, as is boutique shopping and eclectic dining featuring cuisines both regional and far-flung. The world&amp;amp;#39;s finest surfing, snorkeling and diving are also all nearby.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Exploring the island, guests quickly discover why Bali is considered a top destination. Inland, towering volcanoes are wrapped in pristine forests and magnificent temples and centuries-old pagodas emerge from the highlands. The island&amp;amp;#39;s famous beaches range from the striking black sand found along the northern and western coasts, to the white shores of Kuta and Nusa Dua. The coves at Uluwatu and Padang Padang are nearly hidden by cliffs and with a little exploring, travelers uncover many of the island&amp;amp;#39;s lesser-known, &amp;amp;#34;secret&amp;amp;#34; beaches including one with its own secret treasure: A gorgeous waterfall.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Nightly guests or Members and Owners, families or couples, novice travelers or those with globetrotting experience will find Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens the ideal home base for discovering the exotic charm and legendary beauty of Bali.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The distinctive Bali National Golf Club is just minutes away, as is boutique shopping and eclectic dining featuring cuisines both regional and far-flung. The world's finest surfing, snorkeling and diving are also all nearby.
Exploring the island, guests quickly discover why Bali is considered a top destination. Inland, towering volcanoes are wrapped in pristine forests and magnificent temples and centuries-old pagodas emerge from the highlands. The island's famous beaches range from the striking black sand found along the northern and western coasts, to the white shores of Kuta and Nusa Dua. The coves at Uluwatu and Padang Padang are nearly hidden by cliffs and with a little exploring, travelers uncover many of the island's lesser-known, "secret" beaches including one with its own secret treasure: A gorgeous waterfall.
Nightly guests or Members and Owners, families or couples, novice travelers or those with globetrotting experience will find Marriott's Bali Nusa Dua Gardens the ideal home base for discovering the exotic charm and legendary beauty of Bali.

 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;
  ORLANDO, Fla. &amp;#x2013; May 8, 2017 &amp;#x2013;
 &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
 Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club, overlooking beautiful &amp;amp;#39;Anaeho&amp;amp;#39;omalu Bay, is now open on the western shore of Hawaii&amp;amp;#39;s Big Island. Inspired by the island&amp;amp;#39;s lush green flora, pristine waterfalls, fiery red volcanos and black lava beds, the resort&amp;amp;#39;s beautifully decorated one- and two-bedroom suites celebrate the rich culture and diverse landscape of this one-of-a-kind island.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club shares amenities and activities featured by the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp;amp; Spa, including swimming pools, with one just for the kids, a fitness center, tennis facilities, lei-making classes and hula and ukulele lessons. Plenty of upscale shopping and dining are all within walking distance, and nearby on the Kohala Coast two championship golf courses test the skills of all levels.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Those looking for a calming sanctuary and a place to recharge their batteries will find relaxing and rejuvenating treatments inspired by eastern and western cultures at the Mandara Spa, located within the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp;amp; Spa. A signature treatment is the Hawaiian Lomi Lomi massage, the traditional healing massage of Hawaiian royalty.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Of course, no vacation to the Big Island&amp;#x2014;or to Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club&amp;#x2014;would be complete without an authentic Polynesian luau featuring food, dancing and music under the star-filled sky, at the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp;amp; Spa.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Beyond the resort and its on-site beach, adventure awaits. Trails through a lush rainforest can be explored on foot or horseback, and ancient lava tubes and black sand beaches take the breath away. If sights are set even higher, amazing discoveries can be found near active volcanos or the snowcapped summit of Mauna Kea, considered one of the best sites in the world for stargazing.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Beaches on Hawaii&amp;amp;#39;s Big Island are usually less crowded and offer a wide variety of recreational options. Guests can snorkel through the calm, crystal-clear waters at H&amp;#x14D;naunau Bay or learn to surf at surf schools and beginner wave spots along the Kona coast.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Whether it&amp;amp;#39;s the call of adventure or the promise of a rejuvenating escape, an excursion with the family or a dreamy south Pacific getaway for two, Marriott&amp;amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club is the ideal destination to become immersed in the rich culture of Hawaii and experience life in paradise. Aloha!

Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, an exciting extension to the Marriott Vacation Club

The guestrooms and suites at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse properties echo the cosmopolitan nature of their surroundings, each with an updated, modern look and feel that reflects the personal energy and unique culture of their host cities.

 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;
 Exchange Program for arrivals beginning July 1.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 Marriott Vacation Club, San Diego will soon be newly renovated and a totally reimagined vacation escape that greets Owners and guests with a perfect blend of historic ambiance and contemporary design. Inspired by San Diego&amp;#x2019;s renowned Gaslamp Quarter, the 264 well-appointed king, double and connecting two-room suites feature refined wood, metal finishes, sofa beds and stunning San Diego views. The property also has a fitness center, activity and play room and an indoor pool. Renovation of the kids club, indoor pool and fitness area, all common areas and 54 rooms is anticipated to be finished by July 1.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 It&amp;#x2019;s a unique, sophisticated setting to unwind from a day of exploration at the museums of Balboa Park or visiting the legendary San Diego Zoo. It&amp;#x2019;s a place to recharge before venturing out to experience San Diego&amp;#x2019;s amazing nightlife.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 The famous Gaslamp Quarter, just a short stroll away, transforms at night into a sophisticated cosmopolitan playground where locals and visitors alike take advantage of fine dining, craft cocktails, live theater, music, and dancing. Later, guests kick back California-style at the property&amp;#x2019;s Shake lounge, located on the 12th floor. Shake is the central hub of the property and offers a full-service bar, signature cocktails, and light fare. It&amp;#x2019;s the ideal location to finish one day and plan the next.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 With world-class attractions, arts, culture, cuisine and nightlife at your doorstep, Owners and guests will never run out of things to do while visiting one of California&amp;#x2019;s most celebrated coastal cities. Whatever the desire while in San Diego, let curiosity be the guide, discovery be the agenda, and Marriott Vacation Club be the host.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 The Marriott Vacation Club, San Diego joins new Marriott Vacation Club locations in New York City and Miami&amp;#x2019;s South Beach, each available through the Marriott Vacations Club Destinations Exchange Program and Interval International as an exchange option.

  ORLANDO, Fla. &#x2013; February 16, 2018
 &lt;/b&gt;
 &#x2013; The associates at Marriott&amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;#39;s Cove located in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands are excited to welcome back Owners and guests to this exceptional resort today. The resort has been closed since Hurricane Irma hit St. Thomas on September 6, 2017. Marriott&amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;#39;s Cove is one of the first large resorts on St. Thomas to open after recovering from the aftermath of two extremely powerful Category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Associates at Marriott&amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;#39;s Cove have been working hand-in-hand with the remediation company and other local vendors to return the resort to its original splendor all while dealing with their own personal challenges. The associates take such pride in the resort, and they want to ensure Owners and guests have a wonderful vacation experience when they return to St. Thomas. Upon reopening today, Owners and guests are able to enjoy the pool and hot tub, the beach has been cleared and is open for use, the pier is fully restored, the restaurant and Marketplace are open and operating and the resort activities department is operating normally. Crews will continue to work on landscaping and other projects, including building painting, throughout the resort over the next several weeks. Additionally, The Frenchman&amp;#39;s Reef &amp;amp; Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort remains closed due to hurricane damage until further notice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &amp;#34;The unwavering dedication of our associates has shown through during this challenging time at Marriott&amp;#39;s Frenchman&amp;#39;s Cove,&amp;#34; said Scott Derrickson, general manager. &amp;#34;I am so proud of the hard work our associates took on and completed to get the resort back open even though they were also affected personally by these storms. We are grateful to be welcoming our first Owners and guests back to the resort today.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The island of St. Thomas continues to go through a lengthy recovery process. Many restaurants and shops have reopened for business and much of the foliage has made an incredible recovery. Local vendors throughout the island are thrilled to see one of the larger resorts reopening and are eager to be welcoming back visitors to the island. Multiple agencies and organizations have come together to restore St. Thomas, and progress updates are posted regularly by local officials. Visit

 &lt;/strong&gt;
 Marriott&amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens&#x2014;a new resort from Marriott Vacation Club&#x2014;is expected to open January 1, 2018 in Bali, Indonesia. This island paradise, known for its incredible diversity and geographical wonders of ancient temples and palaces, is also home to world-class surfing and diving and a serene attitude framed by turquoise waters and curving coastlines. TripAdvisor recently called Bali the world&amp;#39;s favorite destination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Reservations can be made now by guests, Members and Owners for arrivals beginning January 1, 2018.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Marriott Vacation Club currently has three spectacular properties in Southeast Asia, including Marriott&amp;#39;s Phuket Beach Club and Marriott&amp;#39;s Mai Khao Beach, both in Phuket, Thailand, and Marriott Vacation Club at the Empire Place&#xA9; in Bangkok, Thailand. The planned addition of Marriott&amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens continues the company&amp;#39;s growth strategy of adding new locations to its collection of properties and resorts in Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Nestled within the Nusa Dua beachside community, Marriott&amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens will feature 51 spacious 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, their design inspired by the vivid tropical beauty of Indonesia.  The new resort is also expected to share convenient access to amenities and activities* featured at the adjacent 5-star hotel, the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Nusa Dua, including on-site dining, lagoon-style pool and lazy river, fitness center and spa as well as access to private beach club amenities at Nusa Dua beach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The distinctive Bali National Golf Club is just minutes away, as is boutique shopping and eclectic dining featuring cuisines both regional and far-flung. The world&amp;#39;s finest surfing, snorkeling and diving are also all nearby.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Exploring the island, guests quickly discover why Bali is considered a top destination. Inland, towering volcanoes are wrapped in pristine forests and magnificent temples and centuries-old pagodas emerge from the highlands. The island&amp;#39;s famous beaches range from the striking black sand found along the northern and western coasts, to the white shores of Kuta and Nusa Dua. The coves at Uluwatu and Padang Padang are nearly hidden by cliffs and with a little exploring, travelers uncover many of the island&amp;#39;s lesser-known, &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; beaches including one with its own secret treasure: A gorgeous waterfall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Nightly guests or Members and Owners, families or couples, novice travelers or those with globetrotting experience will find Marriott&amp;#39;s Bali Nusa Dua Gardens the ideal home base for discovering the exotic charm and legendary beauty of Bali.

 &lt;strong&gt;
  ORLANDO, Fla. &#x2013; May 8, 2017 &#x2013;
 &lt;/strong&gt;
 Marriott&amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club, overlooking beautiful &amp;#39;Anaeho&amp;#39;omalu Bay, is now open on the western shore of Hawaii&amp;#39;s Big Island. Inspired by the island&amp;#39;s lush green flora, pristine waterfalls, fiery red volcanos and black lava beds, the resort&amp;#39;s beautifully decorated one- and two-bedroom suites celebrate the rich culture and diverse landscape of this one-of-a-kind island.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Marriott&amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club shares amenities and activities featured by the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp; Spa, including swimming pools, with one just for the kids, a fitness center, tennis facilities, lei-making classes and hula and ukulele lessons. Plenty of upscale shopping and dining are all within walking distance, and nearby on the Kohala Coast two championship golf courses test the skills of all levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Those looking for a calming sanctuary and a place to recharge their batteries will find relaxing and rejuvenating treatments inspired by eastern and western cultures at the Mandara Spa, located within the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp; Spa. A signature treatment is the Hawaiian Lomi Lomi massage, the traditional healing massage of Hawaiian royalty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Of course, no vacation to the Big Island&#x2014;or to Marriott&amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club&#x2014;would be complete without an authentic Polynesian luau featuring food, dancing and music under the star-filled sky, at the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp;amp; Spa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Beyond the resort and its on-site beach, adventure awaits. Trails through a lush rainforest can be explored on foot or horseback, and ancient lava tubes and black sand beaches take the breath away. If sights are set even higher, amazing discoveries can be found near active volcanos or the snowcapped summit of Mauna Kea, considered one of the best sites in the world for stargazing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Beaches on Hawaii&amp;#39;s Big Island are usually less crowded and offer a wide variety of recreational options. Guests can snorkel through the calm, crystal-clear waters at H&#x14D;naunau Bay or learn to surf at surf schools and beginner wave spots along the Kona coast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Whether it&amp;#39;s the call of adventure or the promise of a rejuvenating escape, an excursion with the family or a dreamy south Pacific getaway for two, Marriott&amp;#39;s Waikoloa Ocean Club is the ideal destination to become immersed in the rich culture of Hawaii and experience life in paradise. Aloha!
