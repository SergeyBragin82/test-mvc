Then standing side-by-side with a master chocolatier you develop your own chocolate creations. You learn the secrets of preparing a bubbling caquelon of classic cheese fondue. Your culinary experience will be enhanced by walks through vineyards with breathtaking views, spectacular mountaintop excursions, and guided outings through walled medieval villages and storied castles. Your food adventure in the Swiss Alps includes round trip transfers from the Geneva Airport, six nights hotel accommodations, breakfasts, dinners, ground transportation, excursions, classes, demonstrations, tastings, guided walks, recipes, interpretive notes, and the services of an English-speaking expert guide.

Tucked away in the Tukituki valley it offers views, peace and a tranquility not often found. \r\n\r\nOn our doorstep is world class fly-fishing, golf, hiking, biking and swimming.  Visitors who stay at our cottage often remark not only on the high standard of interiors and facilities, but also on the stunning setting and the peace they find there. \r\n\r\nThe Amphitheatre has been described by internationally recognised singers and musicians as probably the best outdoor venue in the country. Renowned for its acoustics, sitelines and atmosphere it is a truly memorable location. Rather than simply being an uncomfortable slope on a hill, the Black Barn Amphitheatre was carved out of the hillside and purposely built from scratch. Black Barn Vineyards went to a lot of trouble to ensure the space was the perfect outdoor concert venue taking careful consideration of acoustics and views and burying everything from lighting, sound and even eftpos cabling underground. Large flat grassed terraces mean concert-goers sit in comfort with close uninterrupted views of the stage and the whole of Hawkes Bay as their backdrop. Every terrace is fairy lit for concerts and the entire amphitheatre is surrounded by a circle of 50 year-old muscatel grapes. The Black Barn Summer Concert season is restricted to a very limited number of events over Summer and bookings can be made via the winery and website.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter enjoy the intimacy of an Underground Cellar concert, with the warmth of the braziers and New Zealand's best artists, the limited tickets never last long.\r\n\r\nBlack Barn Bistro is the perfect place to spend an hour or two absorbing the atmosphere of Wine Country. It is in the heart of the vineyard surrounded by vines and a table on the large generous veranda lets you look right out across the region. In warmer weather a courtyard covered by a canopy of grapes is also a perfect place to enjoy lunch and a glass of wine. The menu is light, fresh and delicious. There is an emphasis on freshly grown Hawkes Bay produce, the selection changes with the seasons. \r\n\r\nThe Growers’ Market (reopening November 30th) has become a ‘must-do’ for locals and visitors alike on Saturday Mornings through Summer. \r\n\r\nOpen from 9 till Noon every Saturday of summer just follow the line of cars down Black Barn Road to the carparks and you’ll see the market under the trees beside the underground cellars. Under a big ring of Plane trees the canvas covered market has its own place nestled in the heart of the vineyard. Local growers, bakers and producers are either to bed late or up early getting the very freshest and the best produce ready for Market to open at 9am. The market season opens with the new season’s asparagus, strawberries and artichokes and finishes as summer comes to an end with stonefruit peppers and beans. As well as all the seasonal produce, the market is crammed with fresh baked breads, locally roasted coffee, flowers, meat, pickles, olive oil, organic veggies, lavender products etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\nBlack Barn Vineyards are proud to host second round of the Hawke's Bay Cyclocross Series this winter, also being the first round of the National Cyclocross Series. They have a great course incorporating vineyards, an olive grove, limestone roads and it wouldn't be cyclocross without some mud. \r\n\r\nWe have many visitors who return again and again because of this.
